kb_Msuite::kb_MsuiteClient

=head1 DESCRIPTION


A KBase module: kb_Msuite
This SDK module is developed to wrap the open source package CheckM which consists of a set of tools 
for assessing the quality of genomes recovered from isolates, single cells, or metagenomes. 
CheckM consists of a series of commands in order to support a number of different analyses and workflows.

=item Description

Runs CheckM as a command line local function.

subcommand - specify the subcommand to run; supported options are lineage_wf, tetra, bin_qa_plot, dist_plot

bin_folder - folder with fasta files representing each contig (must end in .fna)
out_folder - folder to store output
plots_folder - folder to save plots to

seq_file - the full concatenated FASTA file (must end in .fna) of all contigs in your bins, used
           just for running the tetra command
tetra_File - specify the output/input tetra nucleotide frequency file (generated with the tetra command)

dist_value - when running dist_plot, set this to a value between 0 and 100

thread -  number of threads
reduced_tree - if set to 1, run checkM with the reduced_tree flag, which will keep memory limited to less than 16gb
quiet - pass the --quite parameter to checkM, but doesn't seem to work for all subcommands
